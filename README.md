# CIS-200
These are a handful of programs i worked on during CIS-200 for the class.
The first program started as a mock program to view and sort names and addresses for a company such as UPS. The following programs built upon the original program and led up to being able to add packages and shipments to calculate costs and keep them organized in a list which was viewable in a GUI we built.
